# COIN

The COIN (COntextual INference) model is a principled Bayesian model of learning a motor repertoire in which separate memories are stored for different contexts. Each memory stores information learned about the dynamical and sensory properties of the environment associated with the corresponding context.

The model is described in detail in a [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.23.394320v1) paper by James Heald, Máté Lengyel and Daniel Wolpert.

## Dependencies

The COIN model requires installation of the following packages, which improve the efficiency of the code:

- "[Lightspeed matlab toolbox](https://github.com/tminka/lightspeed)" by Tom Minka. Run install_lightspeed.m to compile the necessary mex files.
- "[Nonparametric Bayesian Mixture Models - release 2.1](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/software.html)" by Yee Whye Teh. Run make.m to compile the necessary mex files.
- "[Truncated Normal Generator](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~zdravkobotev/)" by Zdravko Botev.

Add each package to the MATLAB search path using 
```
addpath(genpath('directory'))
```
where 'directory' is the full path to the root folder of the package.

## The model

### Running the model

The COIN model is implemented as a class in MATLAB. An object of the class can be created by calling
```
obj = COIN;
```
This object has a number of [properties](#properties) that define the model (e.g. number of particles, model parameters) and the paradigm to be simulated (perturbations, sensory cues). Additional properties allow the user to specify which variables to plot.

To simulate learning on a simple paradigm, define a series of perturbations (use NaN to indicate a channel trial):
```
obj.x = [zeros(1,50) ones(1,125) -ones(1,15) NaN(1,150)];
```
and call the run_COIN method on object obj:
```
[S,w] = obj.run_COIN;
```
The adaptation and state feedback is contained in S:
```
figure
plot(obj.x,'k')
hold on
plot(S{1}.y,'m.')
plot(S{1}.yHat,'c')
legend('perturbation','state feedback','adaptation')
```
The state feedback is the perturbation plus random observation noise. In general, the actual observation noise that a participant perceives is unknown to us. You can use the R property to perform multiple runs of the simulation&mdash;each conditioned on a different random sequence of observation noise. For example, to perform 2 runs, call
```
obj.R = 2;
[S,w] = obj.run_COIN;
```
S is a cell array (one cell per run) and w is vector specifying the relative weight of each run. In the absence of adaptation data, each run is assigned an equal weight (see [Inferring internal representations fit to adaptation data](#inferring-internal-representations-fit-to-adaptation-data) for situations in which adaptation is used to assign a weight to each run).

### Plotting internal representations

Use properties to indicate which variables to plot as well as to provide additional information needed to generate the plots (e.g. points to evaluate a distribution at). For example, to plot the distribution of the state of each context and the predicted probabilities set
```
obj.xPredPlot = true; % I want to plot the state | context
obj.gridX = linspace(-1.5,1.5,500); % points to evaluate state | context at
obj.cPredPlot = true; % I want to plot the predicted probabilities
```
These properties must be set *before* running the model so that the relevant variables can be stored for plotting (online inference does not require all variables on all trials to be stored in memory, and so to reduce memory requirements, variables are only stored as needed). See [Properties](#properties) for information on other variables available for plotting.

After running the model, call the plot_COIN method on object obj:
```
[P,S] = obj.plot_COIN(S,w);
```
This will generate a state | context plot and a predicted probabilities plot. The structure P contains the plotted data (view the generate_figures method in COIN.m to see how the data in P is plotted). Note that these plots take some time to generate, as they require contexts in multiple particles and multiple runs to be relabelled on each trial. Once these contexts have been relabelled, the variables to be plotted are then averaged across particles and runs. In general, using more runs will result in less variable results.

### Storing variables

Add the names of the variables you want to store to the store property as strings. For example, to store the Kalman gains and responsibilities
```
obj.store = {'k','cPost'};
```
The store property must be set *before* running the model. The stored variables can be analysed after running the model. For example, the Kalman gain of the context with the highest responsibility can be computed for each particle on each trial:
```
for trial = 1:numel(obj.x) % loop over trials
    for particle = 1:obj.P % loop over particles
        [~,j] = max(S{1}.cPost(:,particle,trial));
        k(particle,trial) = S{1}.k(j,particle,trial);
    end
end
```
Note that this result can be averaged across particles on each trial as all particles within the same run have equal weight. For a full list of the names of variables that can be stored see [Variable names](#variable-names).

### Fitting the model to data

The parameters of the COIN model are fit to data using maximum likelihood estimation. To fit the model, first assign the data to the adaptation property:
```
obj.adaptation = randn(1,150); % random vector (for illustration)
```
The adaptation vector should contain one element per channel trial and be ordered by channel trial number. Once the paradigm and parameters have also been defined (see [Properties](#properties)), the negative log likelihood of the data (the objective to be minimised) can be estimated by calling the objective_COIN method on object obj:
```
o = obj.objective_COIN;
```
This returns a stochastic estimate of the objective. It is stochastic because it is derived from simulations that are conditioned on random observation noise. To reduce the variance of this estimate and aid parameter optimisation, the number of runs used to obtain the estimate can be increased via the R property (this is best done in conjunction with [Parallel Computing](#parallel-computing) to avoid excessive runtimes). The estimate of the objective can then be passed to an optimiser. It is important to use an optimiser that is suited to a stochastic objective function (e.g. [BADS](https://github.com/lacerbi/bads)).

### Inferring internal representations fit to adaptation data

Sometimes, the parameters used to run the COIN model were fit to data (as opposed to being chosen by hand, for example). In this case, the data can be used to infer the internal representations that generated the data. To utilise this information, pass the data to the adaptation property and then call the run_COIN method on object obj:
```
obj.adaptation = randn(1,150); % random vector (for illustration)
[S,w] = obj.run_COIN;
```
Each run is assigned a weight (w) based on how well it explained the adaptation data. In general, these weights will not be equal (although they can be if a resampling step was taken when the weights were last updated). When averaging across runs, these weights should be taken into account.


The sequence of observation noise that a participant perceives is unknown. However, some sequences are more probable than others based on the adaptation data of a participant.

In a [previous section](#running-the-model), we simulated the COIN model by performing many runs on the same paradigm using the same parameters. Each run was conditioned on a different random sequence of observation noise and was assigned an equal weight. If the parameters used to perform the simulation were fit to data, this data can be

simulation by specifying the model parameters and the paradigm. 

### Parallel Computing

It is possible to obtain better fits to data and cleaner internal representations by increasing the number of runs. However, 

The computational complexity of the COIN model scales linearly with the number of runs. To reduce runtime, each run can be performed in parallel across multiple CPU cores (e.g. on a computer cluster). To engage parallel processing, use the maxCores property to specify the maximum number of CPU cores available for use. The default setting of maxCores is 0, which implements serial processing.

This simulation performed inference based on a single sample of the observation noise, which transforms the perturbation into the state feedback. 

### Integrating out observation noise
The basic simulation above have performed inference conditioned on a random sequence of observation noise.
We can repeat the simulation multiple times (each based on a different sequence of observation noise) using the property *R*. For example, to run 2 simulations, call
The output of each and each simulation, or run, is assigned a weight (*w*). In the absence of behavioural adaptation data, all runs are assigned equal weight. If we pass adaptation data via the adaptation property
The more simulations we perform (the greater R is), the greater the computational complexity. If you have access to a computer cluster, you can perform each simulation in parallel, which will speed things up. To do this, specify the maximum number of CPU cores you have access to via the property *maxCores*.
